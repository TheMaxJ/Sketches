Hi There!
These are some of the various Processing experiments I've worked on.
This document is really here to serve as a disclaimer about the contents of this folder, and it is as follows.

--- DISCLAIMER ---
The documents in this folder were, are, will be created for my own personal use.

While you are free to use them, I give no promises that they will
A) Work
B) Be understandable
C) Be Well-written
D) Be Efficient

These are simply ideas I have that I try to program without any planning or forethought.

I WILL NOT be accepting pull requests, nor will I be fixing bugs with the intention of allowing other to use these programs. They are not, have never been, and will never be what I consider a good final product.
